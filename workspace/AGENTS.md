Only **Daily Data Drop** is active. All other campaigns are paused.

- Alert Gilberts at 12/15 posts used in the month

## Tools & Logging

| Campaign        | Tool                          | Log File             | Log Folder          |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Daily Data Drop | **trust8004 API** + Typefully | `data_drop_draft.md` | `daily/YYYY-MM-DD/` |

## Daily Schedule (America/Santiago)

| Time            | Campaign        | Action                     |
| --------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| 9:00 AM (Chile) | Daily Data Drop | Post ecosystem stats tweet |

## Campaign 1: Daily Data Drop (9:00 AM ET)

**Data source:** `node scripts/fetch-metrics.mjs` (outputs JSON to stdout)
**Tool:** Typefully (draft) | **Log:** `data/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/data_drop_draft.md`

### What to include

1. **Headline number**: `totals.registrations24h` new agents + `registrationsDeltaPct` vs yesterday
2. **Per-chain breakdown**: top chains from `chains[]` sorted by `registrations24h`, show delta and trend
3. **Verified endpoints**: `totals.verifiedEndpoints` total + `verifiedEndpointsDeltaAbs` new
4. **Tag chains**: @ethereum @base @0xPolygon @arbitrum @Optimism (only chains with activity)

### Tweet template (vary structure daily, never copy paste)

```
128 new ERC-8004 agents in the last 24h. +24% vs yesterday

Ethereum: 42 (+35%)
Base: 37 (slight dip)
Polygon: 22 (steady)

942 verified endpoints across all chains, 17 new today

@ethereum @base @0xPolygon
```

### Flow

1. Fetch data: `exec node scripts/fetch-metrics.mjs`
2. Parse the JSON output, extract key numbers
3. Draft tweet and save to `data/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/data_drop_draft.md`
4. Send preview to Gilberts via Telegram
5. On approval, create Typefully draft: `typefully drafts:create --text "content"`
6. Confirm to Gilberts: "Draft created in Typefully"

### Rules

- If `fetch-metrics.mjs` fails, report the error to Gilberts via Telegram and skip the Data Drop for the day. Do NOT use web search or any other method to obtain the metrics
- Numbers must match the API response exactly. Never round, estimate, or make up data
- Vary the opening. Don't start with the same phrase two days in a row
- Show trend context: "up from yesterday", "slight dip", "steady", "biggest day this week"
- Only tag chains that have activity in the data (don't tag a chain with 0 registrations)
- Max 2 hashtags in main tweet (#ERC8004, #AIAgents), but skip them if the tweet is tight
- Link goes in a REPLY to your own tweet (trust8004.xyz), never in main tweet
- Follow the Writing Style rules from SOUL.md. No em dashes, no AI-sounding phrases

## Link Strategy

- NEVER put links in main tweet (algorithm suppression)
- Share links in reply to your own tweet
- Use screenshots of scanner results when possible (better engagement)
- Platform URL: trust8004.xyz/agents/CHAINID:ID
